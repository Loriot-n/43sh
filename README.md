# 43sh : Minimalist shell

## Why?

The 42sh is an Epitech project that aims in creating a complete shell from scratch.

We only use Standard CÂ Lib, we wrote it in 2 weeks, in a group of 4 students.

## Features

Launch program from `$PATH`, local executables.
You can use pipes, simple or double redirections.
Line-editing, auto-complete (file, `$PATH` executables), local history.
Wildcards ```*```, config file (.42shrc).

### Built-ins

cd, setenv, unsetenv, alias.

## How to use?

Just clone and ```cd 43sh```, make, and launch with ```./42sh```.

### Options

You can launch the shell with `./42sh -c "some command"` to exit after execution of the argument.
